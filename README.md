# Terrible Volume Adjustment

This Kotlin program is intentionally terrible and allows you to change the 
volume on your computer in a completely unconventional
way: randomly.

To run this program go to the terminal or command line and run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackaholy/KotlinGUI
```
